# Algorithms-Sedgewick

This repository keeps track of implementation of some of the classic and most common datastructures and algorithms taught in course the [Algorithms I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) and [Algorithms II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2) by Robert Sedgewick. I highly recommend this to someone who is starting fresh in the datastructures and algorithms world, or who has been rusty(read out of touch since last couple of years after college). I personally haven't read his [book](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) but its pretty much aligned with what I learned on the course, so I am expecting it to be great as well.

Feel free to raise an issue/bug on the repository if you see something is wrong. Also, feel free to reach out if you wanna chat about classic datastructures and algorithms.
